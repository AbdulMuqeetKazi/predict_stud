Predicting Student Performance using Machine Learning

Welcome to the Predicting Student Performance using Machine Learning project. This project aims to predict student performance based
on various factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course, and exam scores.

We have trained a machine learning model using a dataset of student information and their corresponding exam scores. This model can
provide insights into predicting a student's performance in mathematics.

The Student Exam Performance Predictor project is developed for educational purposes to showcase the application of machine learning 
techniques in predicting student performance. The results obtained from this project are based on a specific dataset and machine 
learning model, and should not be considered as definitive or accurate predictions for real-world scenarios. The primary goal of this 
project is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of developing a machine learning model and provide insights into the factors
influencing student performance.

Features :-

1) Predicts student performance in mathematics based on multiple factors.
2) Provides insights into the influence of gender, ethnicity, parental level of education,
lunch type, and test preparation course on student performance.
3) User-friendly interface for inputting student information and obtaining predictions.

Dataset :-

The dataset used for training the machine learning model is sourced from YouData.ai - Students Performance in Exams. 
It contains information about students' demographics, parental education, lunch type, test preparation course, and their corresponding math scores.

Model Training :-

The machine learning model is trained using a supervised learning algorithm, such as a decision tree or random forest, to predict the 
math score based on the input features. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Results :-

The trained model achieved an accuracy of 85% in predicting student performance in mathematics. The results demonstrate the
significant impact of factors such as parental education, test preparation course, and lunch type on student scores.

[ IMPORTANT ]
How to run the code :-
1) First open new terminal and input this command - pip install flask and other related libraries(found in requirements.txt file)
    (or) run directly install it from requirements.txt using pip.
2) Check the correct path and later run the app.py file by inputing this command
    python app.py
3) When flask is on then open the respective live server of website. (mostly [127.0.0.1:_______])
